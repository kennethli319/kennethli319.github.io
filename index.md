# About

I am deeply passionate about leveraging my expertise in Linguistics and Machine Learning to revolutionize Human-Computer Interaction. Aspiring to contribute significantly to the AI industry, I focus on automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language understanding (NLU), and neurotechnology. My commitment lies in enhancing user experiences by developing innovative solutions in these cutting-edge fields.
