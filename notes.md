1. Language is a condensed representation of the world.
2. Weights in language models are their own form of language.
3. Training a model is designing a language capable of efficiently capturing important aspects of the world.
4. Prediction is compression. And, high velocity of information communication (between neurons, models, beings, organizations) fosters intelligence.
5. Language evolution is driven by its users (not necessarily human); the importance of aspects is always a design choice, even if made unconsciously.
6. Life is a search for the neural connections that best intersect our personal experiences with internal world representations.
7. Inherent truths and information are contained within efficient structures, both tangible and intangible.
8. All representations are simplified projections of a perfect form, differing in perspective.
9. Human languages are a compromised form tailored to our biological capacity for interpersonal communication.
10. Follow the eyes of other beings; they reveal perspectives you might have missed.
11. Meaning is not inherently linear, though its surface form may appear to be.
12. The beauty of art lies in its information density.

13. We are the projection of our experience, both mental and physical.
14. To understand an animal or plant is to grasp its neural connections, shaped by environmental influences over time, even before the existence of that specific being. This applies to humans as well. It's a continuous process along the time dimension, where a being is essentially a projection of cumulative experiences.
15. Technological progression can be measured by the speed at which information is conveyed, transformed, or transferred between individuals, including the cost and time required to train or equip individuals to comprehend technological concepts.
16. "as humans we experience only a tiny slice of the full scale of reality"
17. "We're never gonna know the impact of discovering any single building block of relait"
